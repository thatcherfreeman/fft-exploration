# FFT-Exploration
Hopefully we can figure out a way to implement a FFT within a DCTL, Fuse, or OFX.

## Python Installation
1. (Optional) Make a new python environment with `python -m venv fft-venv` if you want it to be ignored by the gitignore. Enter the environment with `source fft-venv/bin/activate`
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python mft_curve_poc.py sample_images/resolution_chart.jpg`
